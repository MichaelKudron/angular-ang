                Once the dough has properly fermented, it is carefully shaped by hand. This step requires skill and experience, as each baguette must be uniform in shape and size. Our bakers take great pride in this hands-on process, ensuring that each baguette is unique yet consistently excellent. This manual shaping is a testament to our commitment to traditional baking techniques and to maintaining the high standards of quality that define our products.

                The final step is baking the baguettes in high-temperature ovens with steam. This crucial stage is what gives our baguettes their distinctive crispy, golden-brown crust while keeping the interior soft and moist. The steam creates the perfect baking environment, and our bakers closely monitor the process to ensure each baguette is baked to perfection.            </h4>
